      <h2>The History and Facts of Hangman</h2>
      <ol id="lore">
        <li>"As with many games which demand so much practice and preparation, pre-game rituals are a common occurrence for Hangman players. A variety of line-drawing, letter-guessing and eyeball posturing techniques are practiced in preparation for the big game." -Josh Goodall from The Board Game Geek.</li>
         <li>"One of Hangman’s most famous Guessers, Hignan von Shupack, spent years perfecting the triple-dosed-stare. When he finally chose to unleash it at the Northern Ireland Noose Necktie Yearly (NINNY) Championships against amateur Hangman Yuri Glavin; the poor Norwegener had no choice but to fill in the remaining spaces himself or risk implosion." -Josh Goodall from The Board Game Geek.</li>
        "The origins of Hangman are obscure meaning not discovered, but it seems to have arisen in Victorian times," says Tony Augarde, author of The Oxford Guide to Word Games. The game is mentioned in Alice Bertha Gomme's "Traditional Games" in 1894 under the name "Birds, Beasts and Fishes." The rules are simple; a player writes down the first and last letters of a word for an a other player guesses the letters in between. In other sources,[where?] the game is called "Gallows", "The Game of Hangin'", or "Hanger". Hangman has featured in the 1978 Speak & Spell video game system under the name "Mystery Word" and is sometimes played today on Internet forums."

          <p class="description">Cookie Monster (aka Claire) is a Muppet on the long-running children's television show Sesame Street. She is best known for her voracious appetite and her famous eating phrases, such as "Me want cookie!" "Me eat cookie!" and "Om nom nom nom" (said through a mouth full of food). She often eats just about anything, including ice cream, hot dogs, cake, pizza, doughnuts, lettuce, apples, bananas, watermelon, as well as normally inedible objects. However, as her name suggests, her preferred food is cookies. Chocolate chip cookies are his favorite kind; oatmeal cookies are his second favorite. In a song in 2004, Cookie Monster revealed that, before she ate her first cookie, she believed her name was Sid.</p>
